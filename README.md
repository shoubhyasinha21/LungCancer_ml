# LungCancerDetection_ml

🎯 Objective

Build a machine learning model to predict whether a lung cancer patient survives based on demographic, medical, and lifestyle data. The project also includes data exploration to understand important features affecting survival.

📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient information related to lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and health conditions.

Key features include:

Age, gender, country

Cancer stage and diagnosis date

Smoking status and family history

BMI, cholesterol level

Comorbidities (hypertension, asthma, cirrhosis, other cancer)

Treatment type

Target variable: survived (Yes/No)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

🔍 Workflow

Data loading and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and scaling

Model training and evaluation

Survival prediction

✅ Outcome

A trained machine learning model that predicts lung cancer survival and identifies key factors influencing patient outcomes.
